# DeepMusic

Exploring Artistic Creativity in Deep Neural Networks


## Vision
To compare computational creativity through music generation in two kinds of deep neural
nets namely RNN-LSTM (Recurrent Neural Network- Long Short-Term Memory) and
GAN(Generative Adversarial Network).

## Libraries

```
pip install --upgrade pip
```

```
pip install music21
pip install numpy
pip install tensorflow
```
